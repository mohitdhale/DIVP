It contain codes which are of subject named "Digital Image and Video Processing", during my Master's program. All the codes are nothing but kind of processes we need to perform for specific task.These processes are done mostly on Images only.Some are related to videos.

Exp1.m - It contains code of mean,variance,Row & Column Profile, Histogram with and without inbuilt function.

Exp2.m - It contains code of Histogram plotting without using inbuilt function.

Exp3.m - It contains code of Histogram Equalization with & without using inbuilt function.

Exp4.m - It contains code of applying different kinds of filters(like Averaging Filter,High Pass Filter,Laplacian Function,Median Filter or User defined Filter)on Image.

Exp4_G_LPF.m - This is kind of subpart for Exp4 in which Gaussian Low Pass Filter is applied on Image.

Exp4_median.m - This is kind of subpart for Exp4 in which median filter is applied on Image.

Exp5.m - This code is post processing on Gaussian applied filtered image with sobel filter for non-maximal suppression.

Exp6_canny.m - It contains code of Canny Edge Detector.

Exp7_isodata.m - It contains code of Isodata Thresholding (Binary Classification).

Exp7_iterative.m - It contains code of thresholding by iterative method (Binary Classification).

Exp8_otsu.m - It contains code of OTSU Thresholding using with and without inbuilt function.

Exp9_dct.m - It contains code of Image Compression using DCT for 10% quality and 90% quality of an Image.
